# library

Creating a library app using JS, HTML, and CSS. When completed, a user should be able to type various factors about a book (title, author, pages, read status) and have their entry saved on a 'library card', which will evidently keep track of their read history. Entries will be saved to a local device and can be accessed whenever.
